Helps for puredata drums synthesis

[ead~] and [t3env~] are your friends for good envelopes, not [adsr~] which is better suited to non percussion instruments.

All envelopes should be done at audio rate, not control rate for fast percussion to avoid nasty unpredictable clicks.

Always band limit [noise~] sources as there's loads of high frequency stuff in there you cant even hear messing with your signals, I often pop a [lop~ 12000] in for good measure.

Reset the phase of [osc~] and [phasor~] blocks by sending them a |0( message
on each hit for a more consistent sond

[biquad~] far better than [bp~] or [vcf~] for subtle tone control (less coloured and better for fast transients) if you have the patience to set up coefficients

Cowbells etc, try ring mod and fm, the 808 bell contains a prominent perfect 5th

Good woodblock obtained by firing a dirac pulse into a critically damped bp~ filter

Syntax the Nerd (Chris?) already made some nice analog 606/808 style sounds, good to study.

I made a half decent snare by getting the rattle in phase with the skin frequency here (http://obiwannabe.co.uk/padawan12/Electric-Drums.pd)

Delay based physmo using chains of [vd~] will give you some great TomTom resonances if excited by a little burst of noise.

Don't be scared of using plenty of  [clip~] blocks for jailing and limiting or you will most likely end up with sources that are much too lively in dynamics and always going over-level.

Use [switch~] atoms to shut down the entire block computation when its not being used. Amazing how much CPU cycles you can reclaim by doing this.
